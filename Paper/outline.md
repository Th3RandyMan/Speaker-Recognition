# Paper Outline
Feel free to ask me for help on any of this. You are welcome to change this up. 

Don't worry about numbering figures, I'll add in referencing in latex. After the draft is done, we will need to put all the figures in the figures folder. 

* Abstract 
    * Probably leave this for last. Either I can do it, you can, or we have other methods ;)
* Introduction
* Methodology
    * Could be called something else.
    * Review theory (each of these could be subsections):
        * Windowing for each frame of the data (why it is needed)
        * How mfcc algorithm works. Maybe include that figure you made in test 3 of the triangles.
        * Idea behind centroids for localizing samples in space and how centroids are found.
        * How predictions are performed from centroids
* Design Choices
    * What hyperparameters are there.
    * Parameter sweep and best param results
        * Could include figures that I made in the preview
    * Additional processing techniques that could be explored.
* Experimental Tests
    * Take what was done in Tests.ipynb and write about it.
    * Make sure to answer each test (even the painful one of listening to all the audio files and manually predicting)
        * Don't be shy to make tables to summarize results (such as test 1).
* Conclusion
    * Just talk about the results of the tests
* Future works
    * This doesn't need to be large. Maybe just bring up the additional processing techniques in design choices.
    * Maybe mention other ML techniques.
    * Maybe mention what you were saying for recognizing letters. Maybe try to focus in on differences in letters?
* References
    * Maybe reference the centroid paper
    * Maybe reference his lecture
